# Data-Science-Capstone: Healthcare Diabetic
Developed a predictive model to determine diabetes in patients using data from NIDDK. Explored the dataset, handled missing values, and visualized variable distributions. Applied classification algorithms, including KNN, and provided a detailed classification report with sensitivity, specificity, and AUC analysis.

# Project Description:
The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements from a dataset provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The dataset includes variables such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and the outcome variable (0 or 1, indicating the presence of diabetes).

# Week 1 (Data Exploration):
1. Descriptive Analysis: Analyzed the dataset, identified missing values (0 values) in specific columns (Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI), and treated the missing values.
2. Data Type Count Plot: Created a count plot to visualize the data types (integer and float) and the count of variables in the dataset.
3. Data Balance Check: Plotted the count of outcomes (0 or 1) to check the balance in the dataset and planned future actions.
4. Scatter Charts: Created scatter charts to explore relationships between pairs of variables and described the findings.
5. Correlation Analysis: Visualized correlations using a heat map to understand relationships between variables.

# Week 2 (Data Modeling):
1. Model Building Strategy: Devised strategies for model building and selected an appropriate validation framework.
2. Classification Algorithm: Applied a classification algorithm to build a predictive model for diabetes detection.
3. Model Comparison: Compared the results from various models with the KNN algorithm.
4. Classification Report: Analyzed sensitivity, specificity, AUC (ROC curve), and other relevant parameters, and described the values used in the report.
