# Data-Science-Capstone: Healthcare Diabetic
Developed a predictive model to determine diabetes in patients using data from NIDDK. Explored the dataset, handled missing values, and visualized variable distributions. Applied classification algorithms, including KNN, and provided a detailed classification report with sensitivity, specificity, and AUC analysis.

# Project Description:
The project is aimed at predicting whether a patient has diabetes or not based on various medical diagnostic measurements. The dataset used is from the NIDDK and includes variables such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, insulin, and age. The target variable is "Outcome," with values of 0 or 1.

# Week 1: Data Exploration:
Conducted descriptive analysis of the dataset to understand the variables.
Identified missing values (0 values) in variables: Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, and handled them appropriately.
Created histograms to visually explore the distribution of these variables.
Generated a count plot to show the data type distribution of variables (integer and float).

# Week 2: Data Modeling:
Devised model building strategies and selected an appropriate validation framework.
Applied a classification algorithm to build a predictive model.
Compared the model's performance with KNN algorithm results.
Created a classification report, analyzing sensitivity, specificity, AUC (ROC curve), and explained the parameter values used.
